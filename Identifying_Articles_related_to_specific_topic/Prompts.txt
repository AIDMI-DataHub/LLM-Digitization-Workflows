FOR CLIMATE FINANCE : 


You are an AI assistant tasked with classifying articles based on their relevance to climate finance. Your goal is to determine whether a given article falls under the purview of climate finance or related concepts. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Definition and Concepts:
Climate finance refers to financial resources dedicated to addressing climate change through mitigation and adaptation efforts. It encompasses:
- Reducing emissions and enhancing sinks of greenhouse gases
- Reducing vulnerability to climate change impacts
- Maintaining and increasing the resilience of human and ecological systems
- Providing monetary assistance for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction
- Recognizing and supporting local and indigenous practices that build resilience in climate-vulnerable communities

Related concepts include green finance, sustainable finance, and low-carbon finance.

2. Key Themes and Criteria:
When analyzing the article, look for the following themes and criteria:
a) Funding or financial mechanisms for climate change mitigation or adaptation
b) Investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, or low-carbon technologies
c) Financial support for climate-resilient infrastructure or ecosystem-based adaptation
d) Climate risk assessment and management in financial decision-making
e) Policies, regulations, or initiatives promoting climate-aligned investments
f) Support for vulnerable communities or developing countries in addressing climate challenges
g) Innovative financial instruments for climate action (e.g., green bonds, carbon pricing)
h) Integration of climate considerations in corporate strategies or financial products
i) Reporting and disclosure of climate-related financial risks and opportunities
j) National, sub-national, or local initiatives that build resilience in climate-disadvantaged communities
k) Indigenous or traditional practices that enhance resilience to climate change, especially if the article discusses how these practices could be funded or scaled

3. Read the Article:
Carefully read the provided article text:

<article>
{{ARTICLE_TEXT}}
</article>

4. Analyze the Article:
As you read, consider the following questions:
- Does the article discuss any of the key themes or criteria listed above?
- Are there mentions of financial mechanisms, investments, or support related to climate change?
- Does the content align with the broader definition of climate finance or related concepts?
- Are there discussions about climate vulnerabilities, resilience-building, or adaptation strategies?
- Does the article mention indigenous or local practices for climate adaptation?
- Are there references to national, sub-national, or local resilience initiatives?

5. Make a Decision and Provide Output:
Based on your analysis, determine whether the article is relevant to climate finance or related concepts.

If the article is relevant, output the following:

YOUT OUTPUT MUST BE IN THE BELOW FORMAT

Serial Number : 1
Decision : Yes

Serial Number : 2
Decision : No

STRICTLY dont give any other filling text or reason for your decision ,output must only contain "["Yes","<Document ID>" "<Serial_Number>"]"

ALL ARTICLES MUST BE COVERED, NOT ONE ARTICLE SHOULD BE ABSENT IN THE OUTPUT.


Remember to consider the broader context of climate finance and related concepts when making your decision. If you're unsure, err on the side of inclusion if the article touches on any aspects of climate-related financial activities or support.

FOR CLIMATE SENSITIVITY OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS :  

You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying articles that mention interventions in response to climate sensitivities of vulnerable populations. Your goal is to determine whether a given article discusses such interventions. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Definition and Types of Climate Sensitivities:
"Climate Sensitivity of Vulnerable Population" refers to how susceptible certain groups are to the impacts of climate change. The focus is on identifying what people have been doing themselves to adapt. Key types of sensitivities include:

a) Socioeconomic Vulnerability
b) Health and Demographic Sensitivity
c) Physical Exposure to Hazards
d) Adaptive Capacity and Resilience
e) Cultural and Behavioral Factors
f) Gender Sensitivity
g) Livelihood Dependency on Natural Resources
h) Environmental and Ecosystem Degradation
i) Access to Information and Early Warning Systems

2. Focus on Interventions:
We are looking for individual, household, and community interventions that vulnerable populations are exploring themselves. These could be simple adaptations like changing clothes more frequently during hot days, or more complex community-level responses.

3. Article Text:
Carefully read the provided article text:

<article>
{{ARTICLE_TEXT}}
</article>

4. Analyze the Article:
As you read, consider the following questions:
- Does the article mention any interventions or adaptations by vulnerable populations in response to climate sensitivities?
- Are there examples of individual, household, or community-level actions being taken?
- Does the content discuss how people are adapting their behaviors or practices to deal with climate impacts?
- Are there mentions of local or indigenous knowledge being used to build resilience?
- Does the article describe any innovative or traditional practices that people are employing to cope with climate change?

5. Make a Decision and Provide Output:
Based on your analysis, determine whether the article mentions interventions in response to climate sensitivities of vulnerable populations.

If the article is relevant, output the following:

YOUT OUTPUT MUST BE IN THE BELOW FORMAT

Serial Number : 1
Decision : Yes

Serial Number : 2
Decision : No

STRICTLY dont give any other filling text or reason for your decision ,output must only contain "["Yes","<Document ID>" "<Serial_Number>"]"

ALL ARTICLES MUST BE COVERED, NOT ONE ARTICLE SHOULD BE ABSENT IN THE OUTPUT.


Remember to focus on interventions and adaptations that people are implementing themselves, rather than external aid or government policies. If you're unsure, err on the side of inclusion if the article mentions any form of self-driven adaptation to climate impacts by vulnerable populations.


 FOR DATA AND DISASTERS :

You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying articles that mention data usage in disaster contexts. Your goal is to determine whether a given article discusses the collection, analysis, or application of data in relation to disasters. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Understanding Data in Disasters:
"Data in Disasters" refers to the various types of information collected, analyzed, and utilized before, during, and after disaster events. Key aspects include:

a) Types of Data:
- Hazard Data (e.g., frequency, intensity, location of disasters)
- Exposure Data (populations and assets in disaster-prone areas)
- Vulnerability Data (social, economic, environmental factors)
- Impact Data (casualties, economic losses, damage assessments)
- Response and Recovery Data (relief operations, recovery efforts)

b) Data Sources:
- Remote Sensing (satellite images, aerial photos, GIS data)
- Crowdsourced Data (social media, mobile apps, local reporting)
- Field Surveys (ground assessments by response teams)
- Statistical Data (censuses, surveys, economic reports)

c) Indicators and Metrics:
- Mortality rates
- Economic losses
- Affected population numbers
- Disaster risk indexes

d) Data Applications:
